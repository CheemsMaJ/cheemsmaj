    <h1>[This is just a test]</h1>
    <p>It is a short and simple portfolio of Majimer</p>

    <p>Majimer is a name reference to Goro Majima from a game franchise named "Yakuza" AKA "Ryu Ga Gotoku" by SEGA.
        The character himself has a chaotic personality and his competitiveness bears a huge resemblance to my characteristics.
    </p>    
    <p></p>
        This is just purely a testing website that acts as my portfolio and will be in development.
